## Intro

Started with Ubuntu dualbooting Win 10, but corrupted for some reason.
Decided might as well try Kali linux since I wanted to play around with pentesting stuff, so that's what I'm using now.

Still lost few things along the way though like my custom login screen based around Lain's Copland OS thing I found on github.

## Keyboard Bindings
Had to use different binds since each of them couldn't do the other for some reason, at least it works for the most part.

Current settings: 
- Caps lock & CTRL swap = [XKB File edit](https://gist.github.com/dmgl/f5ec96dfe3af1652792089ebf6683431)
- Backspace and Backslash swap = [xmodmap commands](https://askubuntu.com/questions/54157/how-do-i-set-xmodmap-on-login)
- IJKL Arrow keys (Alt+IJKL for arrow keys) = [Autokey](https://github.com/autokey/autokey)
