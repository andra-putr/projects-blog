## Extending WiFi (eduroam) signal at uni

No WiFi signal in clubhouse... but they wanted me to rent a seperate internet package instead, sad!

Will probably install OpenWRT onto Router I received from softbank, use that as AP to PC then repeat signal. 
Will see about disadvantages after I get it up and running.
