Got this from Akihabara for super cheap, turns out it was the perfect form factor and platform to get a USB rubber ducky for less than 1/4 the price of what you can get on Hak5. It uses the exact same chip as on the Raspberry Pi pico, so it's pretty much compatible with any pico projects I believe.

Looked up people making bad USBs from raspi pico's (like [NetworkChuck's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_f9p-_JWZw)), but was still irked by the fact that it was really bulky when he was using the raspi pico with all the cables sticking out of it. This on the other hand came in one neat little package and is ready for you to flash stuff on it.

You can find my scripts on my [github page](https://github.com/andra-putra/rp2040one-RubberDucky), but I haven't done anything much yet other than writing a few test scripts to confirm it was indeed working. After looking around forums a bit, it seems like I'd need to learn way more shellscript and CMD commands on windows before making anything complicated.

In the future, I'd like it to be able to do things like:
- Install [Bonzi Buddy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9DST-6jIBU) on a target computer
- Launches a simple image that can't be closed on the main screen
- Getting credential exfil scripts to work 
- etc.
