## Intro

Started with Ubuntu dualbooting Win 10, but corrupted for some reason.
Decided might as well try Kali linux since I wanted to play around with pentesting stuff, so that's what I'm using now.

Still lost few things along the way though like my custom login screen based around Lain's Copland OS thing I found on github.

## Keyboard Bindings
Had to use different binds since each of them couldn't do the other for some reason, at least it works for the most part.

Current settings: 
- Caps lock & CTRL swap = [XKB file edit](https://gist.github.com/dmgl/f5ec96dfe3af1652792089ebf6683431)
- Backspace and Backslash swap = [xmodmap commands + autostart on boot](https://askubuntu.com/questions/54157/how-do-i-set-xmodmap-on-login)
- ~~IJKL Arrow keys (Alt+IJKL for arrow keys)~~ = [Autokey](https://github.com/autokey/autokey)
	- **UPDATE**: As of 2023/1/16, due to me wanting to learn vim I've changed it to HJKL instead.

## Japanese Input

This was initially quite an annoying issue to deal with for me, since I was really adamant about my keyboard shortcuts (as can be seen with me having all those keyboard macros and switches). Since inputting Japanese through a keyboard requires you to press several more keys to choose input method etc., this also of course meant that my usual workflow when using Japanese on a computer is also modified quite a bit and I am really only fully comfortable with my own setup. 

### JP Input on Windows
I first learned Japanese (including how to type in Japanese) on a windows machine back home, so it naturally became the input method that I'm most used to. I used Google's Japanese IME on a standard ANSI keyboard which had shortcuts such as:
- Win + Spacebar = Switch language (Windows shortcut)
- L_Alt + \` = Switch input mode (Romaji --> ひらがな --> カタカナ)
- Shift

### JP Input on Linux
