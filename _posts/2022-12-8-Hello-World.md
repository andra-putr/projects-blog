Test first post.
We'll see how hard this jekyll thing is to actually use.


~~Edit: Currently using [prose.io](https://github.com/prose/prose) to speed up the workflow because I _really_ don't want to deal with HTML and CSS when I just want to write my thoughts down.~~

As of 2023/1/17:
- Switched to stackedit.io instead of prose.io since I just lose about 1 hour's worth of writing when accidentally closed browser when using prose.io huheh. Stackedit has local storage so it auto syncs and stuff too which is super neat.
