## Intro

Been a while since I've had this thing, bought it all the way back in 2017 when I was getting ready to go to uni in Melbourne.
Was gonna take computer science, so was thinking a thinkpad would be fitting for that role.
Here are some of the things I want to do to it:

- Hardware
  - New battery
  - New SSD
  - Replace thermal paste
- Software
  - Dualboot Ubuntu
  - GNU GRUB Themes
  - Custom boot logo
  - Ubuntu issues
      - Trackpad gestures
      - Fingerprint scanner
      - Re-making macros (arrow keys layer, CTRL CAPS swap, etc.)
      - Japanese IME with ANSI keyboard


## Hardware
### New Battery
After about 5 years of use, the battery went down from its original capacity of 57MwH --> ~21MwH.
This meant that the battery life went from about 7+ hours to barely 2 hours! Surprised I didn't even realize how bad it was, I suppose the change was too gradual for me to notice until I ran a 
> powercfg /batteryreport
