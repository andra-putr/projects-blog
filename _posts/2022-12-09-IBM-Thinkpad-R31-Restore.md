# Intro

## Restoring Used IBM Thinkpad R31 from Akihabara

Will try and install Windows 98, 2000, or XP on it.

Many such troubles since I don't have CD nor floppy drive. Also never used floppy disk before so this'll be interesting.
And here I thought it'll be a simple boot from USB fix..

**Project Log: Retro ThinkPad Windows Installation**

**Date:** January 12, 2024  
**Time:** 00:43 (Midnight)

**Introduction:**  
Embarking on a nostalgic project to breathe new life into a Retro ThinkPad by installing an older version of Windows. The primary aim is to relive the experience of classic Windows operating systems, possibly Windows 98, Windows XP, or Windows 2000.

**Progress Overview:**

- **Hardware Installations:**  
  - Successfully installed an IDE hard drive and a new CD drive on the ThinkPad.
  - Prepared a collection of CD and CDR discs for software installation.

- **Software Goals:**  
  - Considering Windows 98 or Windows XP for installation, despite the original OS being Windows 2000 (as indicated by the sticker on the laptop).
  - The installation of Windows XP is preferred for this nostalgia project.

- **Current Challenges:**
  - The ThinkPad does not support booting from USB, limiting installation options.
  - Lack of access to genuine Windows XP or Windows 2000 installation discs.
  - Managed to install OpenDOS using a CD-flashed ISO, but facing issues with Windows installation.
  - Encountering a 'Drive not ready' error when attempting to access the Windows 98 or XP CDs in the CD drive.

**Next Steps:**

- Research and troubleshoot the CD drive issue to successfully load the Windows installation.
- Explore alternative methods for installing Windows without a genuine disc.

**Closing Thoughts:**  
This project is paused for now, but will resume with new insights and solutions to overcome the current hurdles.
